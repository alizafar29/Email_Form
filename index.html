        <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
        <p>Yes,you are right!As part of mu post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,my favouriate dance are as follows,with definitions:</p>
        <dt>Polynesian chickemn dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance datingback as for as 300BC,a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to incourage to their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q>.</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian dance</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance,which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation,English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q>,stilled movements,being practice by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
        <p>For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page</a>.</p>
        <p>Your sincerely,</p>
